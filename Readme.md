# Rust Playground
Just trying out some cool new features of fast and secure rust!

## Unique
* Ownership
* Lifetime of traits

## New wording
* owning variables ony at one time, ends automaticly with closing function, 
* borrowing can borrow a variable 
* traits (Mekrmale) similar to interfaces, can be reused and reimplemented (here `PartialOrd`)
* `'a` lifetime assosications
